## Postman collection
https://www.getpostman.com/collections/d4696fde53ce2fe2778e

In order to use postman collection, you need to create an environment and set 
'baseUrl' = {your_server_ip}/api/v1/

In my case, 'baseUrl' = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/'


## How to run backend & frontend
1. clone this repository
2. cd to repository root folder
3. run: docker-compose up
4. That's it.

  The api url by default is http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/ and the frontend url is http://127.0.0.1:3000/

  ### Note:
  Please, take into account that, the API works with local branches, so it is a good idea to fetch several remote branches running docker.
